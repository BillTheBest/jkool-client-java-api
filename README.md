# jKool Streaming & Query API

###Why jKool Streaming & Query API?
jKool Streaming & Query API allows you to stream events, metrics, transactions as well as execute queries against jKool streams. You will need a streaming  "access token‚Äù in order to stream & query your data. This token is associated with a repository assigned to you when you sign-up for jKool. Other language bindings can be generated with the Swagger Code Generator using the Swagger yaml file found it the "swagger" folder. Please be aware the the Swagger yaml file is documenting every field that can be passed via Restful API.

###jKool Streaming Concepts and Documentation
You can find very comprehensive documentation on jKool Data Types and Concepts in our jKool Streaming Guide found here: https://www.jkoolcloud.com/download/jkool-model.pdf. But basically, there are four types of data that can be streamed into jKool. They are:
* Events: Represents a basic time series element containing time, message, severity and other fields associated with event.
* Activities: Represents a group of events and other activities (e.g. transactions).
* Snapshots: categorized metrics (name, value, type) at a "point in time". Snapshots can be associated with events, activities.
* Properties: simple metrics (name, value pairs). Properties can be associated with events, activities. 

In addition to the Streaming Guide, this Git repository contains a Swagger yaml file. Open this file in a Swagger Editor and you will have detailed documentation of each field that comprises the above mentioned data.

###Streaming Examples
To use this sample code please do the following:
* Run mvn install on the project. This will generate a jar file (found in the target directory).
* Import this jar file into your own project in which you wish to stream to jKool. 
* Please see the sample classes and run them in order to get a good understanding on how to use the helper code. You will be doing the following:
* Instantiate the `JKStream` class. You will need to pass it the access token you received when you signed up for jKool. This token will grant you access to stream and also ensure that the data goes to the proper repository.
```java
	JKStream jkSend = new JKStream("yourtoken");
```
* Instantiate the object you wish to stream. Then populate all of the fields you wish to stream. For example:
```java
	Event event = new Event("Casablanca");
	event.setAppl("WebOrders").setServer(InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName())
	        .setNetAddr(InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostAddress()).setDataCenter("DCNY")
	        .setElapsedTimeUsec(TimeUnit.HOURS.toMicros(2)).setLocation("New York, NY")
	        .setMsgText("Casablanca is playing.");

```
Please note that this example code depicts streaming in real-time. Therefore the start date of the event will default to the current date/time and the end date will default to the start date plus the elapsed time. You can however control start/end dates. For example:
```java
	event.setTime(System.currentTimeMillis()).setElapsedTimeUsec(TimeUnit.HOURS.toMicros(2));
```

* Finally, invoke the post method on the `jKoolStream` object, passing it the object you wish to stream. For example:

```java
	JKStream jkSend = new JKStream("yourtoken");
	Event event = new Event("Casablanca");
	event.setAppl("WebOrders").setServer(InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName())
		.setNetAddr(InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostAddress()).setDataCenter("DCNY")
		.setElapsedTimeUsec(TimeUnit.HOURS.toMicros(2)).setLocation("New York, NY")
		.setMsgText("Casablanca is playing.");
	Response response = jkSend.post(event);
	response.close();
```
The Rest Client will properly format the entity into JSON format and stream it to jKool over default `https` protocol.

That's it!! Any problems or concerns, please email us at (`support at jkoolcloud.com`).

###Running jKool Queries
Below is an example of running a JKQL query against a repository associated with a specified access token `yourtoken`:

```java
	JKQuery jkQuery = new JKQuery("yourtoken");
	Response response = jkQuery.call("get number of events for today");
	Map<String, Object> jsonResponse = response.readEntity(Map.class);
	response.close();
```
All returned JKQL responses are JSON.
Developers can also invoke JKQL queries asynchronously using callbacks. See example below:
```java
	// setup jKool WebSocket connection and connect
	JKQueryAsync jkQuery = new JKQueryAsync("yourtoken");
	jkQueryAsync.addConnectionHandler(new JKRetryConnectionHandler(5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS));
	jkQueryAsync.addConnectionHandler(new MyConnectionHandler());
		
	// setup a default response handler for responses not associated with any specific query
	jkQueryAsync.addDefaultCallbackHandler(new MyJKQueryCallback());
	jkQueryAsync.connect(); // connect stream with WebSocket interface
		
	// run query in async mode with a callback
	JKQueryHandle qhandle = jkQueryAsync.callAsync("get events", new MyJKQueryCallback());
	qhandle.awaitOnDead(10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); // optional wait 10s query finished
	...
	jkQueryAsync.close(); // close connection
```
`MyJKQueryCallback` is called when a result from the query is received. Responses not associated with any specific query are handled by a default response handler specified by `jkQueryAsync.addDefaultCallbackHandler(...)` call.
```java
public class MyJKQueryCallback implements JKQueryCallback {
	@Override
	public void handle(JKQueryHandle qhandle, JsonObject response, Throwable ex) {
		System.out.println("response: handle=" + qhandle + ", response=" + response);
		if (ex != null) {
			System.out.println("error: handle=" + qhandle + ", error=" + ex);
		}	
	}

	@Override
    public void dead(JKQueryHandle qhandle) {
		if (trace) {
			out.println("Dead handle=" + qhandle + ", dead=" + qhandle.isDead());
		}
	}
}
```
Connection handler can be used to intercept and handle WebSocket connection events such as open, close, error:
```java
public class MyConnectionHandler implements JKConnectionHandler {
	@Override
	public void error(JKQueryAsync async, Throwable ex) {
		System.err.println("error:: " + async + ", error=" + ex);
		ex.printStackTrace();
	}

	@Override
	public void close(JKQueryAsync async, CloseReason reason) {
		System.out.println("close: " + async + ", reason=" + reason);
	}

	@Override
	public void open(JKQueryAsync async) {
		System.out.println("open: " + async);
	}
}

```
`jkQueryAsync.callAsync()` returns a query handler (instance of `JKQueryHandle`), which can be used later to cancel subscriptions.
Cancelling an active query subscription attempts to stop any streaming traffic associated with a specific subscription.
Cancellation is also issued asynchronously and any responses that are still in transit will be routed to the default response handler specified by `addDefaultCallbackHandler()` call.
```java
	// run query in async mode with a callback
	JKQueryHandle qhandle = jkQueryAsync.callAsync("get number of events for today", new MyJKQueryCallback());
	...
	// attempt to cancel subscription to the query results
	jkQueryAsync.cancelAsync(qhandle);
```
###Subscribing to real-time event streams
Developers can also subscribe to live data streams using `JKQueryAsync` class. Subscriptons are based continous queries submitted by the client and run on the jKool servers. The results of the query are emmitted as data becomes available and streamed back to the client call back handler instance of `JKQueryCallback`. See example below:
```java
	// setup jKool WebSocket connection and connect
	JKQueryAsync jkQuery = new JKQueryAsync("yourtoken");
	jkQueryAsync.addConnectionHandler(new JKRetryConnectionHandler(5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS));
	jkQueryAsync.addConnectionHandler(new MyConnectionHandler());
		
	// setup a default response handler for responses not associated with any specific query
	jkQueryAsync.addDefaultCallbackHandler(new MyJKQueryCallback());
	jkQueryAsync.connect(); // connect stream with WebSocket interface
		
	// run subscription query in async mode with a callback
	JKQueryHandle qhandle = jkQueryAsync.subAsync("events where severity > 'INFO'", new MyJKQueryCallback());
	...
```
The code above is equivalent to the JKQL statement `subscribe to events where severity > 'INFO'`. `MyJKQueryCallback()` gets called as the query matches incoming streams. All pattern stream matching is done on the jKool server side. `subscribe` query runs on real-time streams only and never on past data. Use `get` queries to get past data.

###Running jKool searches on message content
`JKQueryAsync` class provides a helper method to run pattern macthes against event message content. See below:
```java
	// run search query in async mode with a callback
	JKQueryHandle qhandle = jkQueryAsync.searchAsync("failure", 10, new MyJKQueryCallback());
	...
```
The code above is equivalent to the JKQL statement `get events where message contains "failure"`, where 10 is the maximum number of matching rows to return (default is 100). The example above can be implemented as:
```java
	// run query in async mode with a callback
	JKQueryHandle qhandle = jkQueryAsync.callAsync("get events where message contains \"failure\"", 10, new MyJKQueryCallback());
	...
```
###Running jKool queries from command line
You can run jKool queries from command line using a helper class `JKQLCmd` below:
```sh
	java -jar jkool-java-rest-<version>.jar -token access-token -query "get number of events" -wait 30000
```
Running message payload searches:
```sh
	java -jar jkool-java-rest-<version>.jar -token access-token -search "failure" -wait 30000
```
Command line arguments can be specified via a property file, where any command line argument overrides values specified in the property file:
```sh
java -jar jkool-java-rest<version>.jar -file cmd.properties -query "get number of events for today"
```
Bleow is an example of a property file containing command line arguments (token should have your jKool API access token):
```properties
token=your-access-token
uri=ws://jkool.jkoolcloud.com/jKool/jkqlasync
query=get number of events
trace=true
wait=15000
maxrows=100
retry=0
#get=jk_response/rows-found
```

###Important note
This sample code showcases some basic examples of using jKool Rest API. jKool can handle very complex application interactions. For example, it is built with the ability to correlate events and track transactions across multiple applications. This can be used for complex tracking and analytics.

###Streaming with Curl
Data can also be streamed into jKool using Curl. Below is an example:

```java
curl -i -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "token:YOURTOKEN" -X POST https://data.jkoolcloud.com/JESL/event -d '{"operation":"streamingwithcurl","type":"EVENT","start-time-usec":1457524800000000,"end-time-usec":1457524800000000,"msg-text":"Example Curl Streaming","source-fqn":"APPL=TestingCurl#SERVER=CurlServer100#NETADDR=11.0.0.2#DATACENTER=DC1#GEOADDR=52.52437,13.41053"}'
```

###Streaming with Python
Data can also be streamed into jKool using Python. To do so, you will need to use the Python "Request". Details on the Python Request can be found here - http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/. Below is an example of using it to stream into jKool:

```java
import requests
headers = {'token': 'YOURTOKEN'}
payload={'operation':'streamingwithpython','type':'EVENT','start-time-usec':1457524800000000,'end-time-usec':1457524800000000,'msg-text':'Example Python Streaming','source-fqn':'APPL=TestingCurl#SERVER=CurlServer100#NETADDR=11.0.0.2#DATACENTER=DC1#GEOADDR=52.52437,13.41053'}
r = requests.post('https://data.jkoolcloud.com/JESL/event', headers=headers, json=payload)
```
###Query jKool using Curl

Rest can be used to retrieve data out of jKool. To do this, make use of the jKool Query Language (JKQL). Please see JKQL Documentation here http://www.jkoolcloud.com/download/jKQL%20User%20Guide.pdf. To use JKQL via Restful Services, pass your repository and repository credentials (username and password) in the request header. Then issue the GET request via the following URL https://jkool.jkoolcloud.com/jKool/jkql passing the JKQL in a 'query' parameter. For instance, to get all activities in your repository, do the following in curl: 

```java
curl -i -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "username:<username>" -H "password:<password>" -H "repositoryId:<repository identifier>" -X GET https://jkool.jkoolcloud.com/jKool/jkql?query=get%20activities
```
